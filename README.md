# Comparisions-of-Algorithms
In this project, the efficiency of five algorithms was tested on a randomly generated data set. The number of comparisons required by each algorithm were counted against the size of the input array. Then a graph was plotted using GNU-Plot and Okular. Also, report and presentation were made using Latex.
